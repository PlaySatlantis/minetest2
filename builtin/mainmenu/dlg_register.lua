and our Third-Party Service Providers will collect

By linking a Member Card in connection with transaction 
monitoring, you authorize Figg Inc. on behalf of 
Satlantis to share your Member Card information with your 
payment Card Network, such as MasterCard or Visa, so it 
knows you enrolled. You authorize the payment Card 
Network to monitor transactions on your Member Card(s)

whether you have qualified for or earned a Card-Linked 
Offer, and for the payment Card Network to share such 
transaction details with Figg, Inc. and Satlantis to 
enable your Card-Linked Offer and to target offers that 
may be of interest to you. To opt-out of transaction 
monitoring on your Member Card(s) and unlink your Member 
Card(s), you must follow the steps below:

	1. Go to account settings;
	2. Click on Delete Card; and
	3. Confirm you want to delete card.

wishto unlink. Once your Member Card is unlinked, your

longer be eligible to receive any Card-Linked Offers for 
the associated Member Card, however you will still be 
eligible to accumulate Points in other ways including: 
the purchase of Gift Cards and/or additional promotions 
like education, referral, and other bonuses. Unlinked 
Member Cards will still be eligible to be used as a 
payment method for any purchases you make within our 
application.

4. How You Can Earn Points.

(a) Qualifying Purchases using Member Cards. You’ll earn
Points when you use a Member Card to make Qualifying 
Purchases, minus any returns or refunds. The following 
transaction types shall not be deemed Qualifying 
Purchases: purchases not eligible for Card-Linked 
Offers; balance transfers; cash advances; purchase of 
travelers’ checks, foreign currency, money orders, wire 
transfers or similar cash-like transactions; purchase 
of lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, racetrack 
wagers or similar betting transactions; interest; 
unauthorized or fraudulent charges; fees of any kind, 
including an annual fee, if applicable; and purchases 
made prior to signing up for the Program.

For each Qualifying Purchase, you will receive a number of 
Points, based on the transaction amount and the 
Card-Linked Offer, if applicable. Points are only earned 
on the amount actually spent on Qualifying Purchases. If 
Points are issued for a Qualifying Purchase that is later 
returned or refunded, or the transaction is otherwise 
voided, the corresponding Points will be automatically 
removed from your Account whether or not those Points 
are in your Pending Balance or your Available Balance. 
Members may not separate Qualifying Purchases into 
multiple transactions for the purpose of earning more 
Points than would otherwise be available through a single 
transaction.

Each Card-Linked Offer will pay you a percentage or fixed 
amount of the Qualifying Purchase value as Points. For 
example, one Merchant might have a Card-Linked Offer of 
5%, so if you spend $100 at that Merchant you would 
receive the number of Points equal to the equivalent of 
$5 in Sats, based on the then-current bitcoin exchange 
rate (plus 2.1% of the bitcoin Dollar value, as further 
described in Section 4(C)) at the time of the Qualifying 
Purchase, and converted to Points based on a direct Sats 
to Points (i.e., 1:1) conversion rate. Some Card-Linked 
Offers have caps on the number of Points you can earn.

Points will not appear or be reflected on your 
transaction receipt from the Merchant at the time of 
purchase and will instead be reflected in your Account. 
Subject to eligibility verification and settlement of 
the Qualifying Purchase, Points will typically appear 
in your Account approximately seven (7) days after the 
Qualifying Purchase but may be subject to delays.

Points cannot be processed if your Member Card number 
expires or changes while the Points are pending and not 
settled, or your Account is not open or in good standing. 
You may not receive Points if the applicable transaction 
is not posted by your Member Card issuer. Except where 
prohibited by applicable law, which may include Quebec, 
Satlantis, the applicable Card Network, the Member Card 
issuers and the Gift Card issuers have no responsibility 
or liability for the failure of Points to be posted to 
your Account, or for any charge, or impact on any 
rewards, feature, or term of your Account resulting 
from the Points being credited to your Account.

In no event shall the applicable Card Network or a Gift 
Card issuer be considered as maintaining any type of 
financial obligation or deposit or other asset account 
or holding funds or other value for you for distribution 
to you. Any pending Points represent offer fulfillment 
amounts in process owed by the applicable Merchant, and 
not funds or balances maintained or held by the payment 
Card Network, the Gift Card issuer or Satlantis.

(b) Gift Card Purchases. You’ll earn Points when you 
purchase a Gift Card on the App or the Website. Gift 
Cards may only bepurchased using bitcoin, or such other 
payment method the Company determines in its sole 
discretion from time to time, which may include credit or 
direct bank account debit. Gift Cards may not be 
purchased for resale. Members may not separate purchases 
of Gift Cards into multiple transactions for the purpose 
of earning more Points than would otherwise be available 
through a single transaction.

Each purchase of a Gift Card will pay you a percentage 
of the Gift Card value as Points calculated in the same 
manner as set out in Section 4(a) above. Some Gift Cards 
have caps on the number of Points you can earn. You do 
not earn Points on the value of the subsequent purchase 
of products using a Gift Card.

You may view your Points by logging into your Account. 
Most Points earned for Gift Card purchases will post to 
your Available Balance within 24 hours. We will let you 
know if it will take longer for your Points to post.

(c) Points Calculations. Each Qualifying Purchase shall 
occur on an applicable event date and the Company shall 
calculate thenumber of Points earned based on the 
applicable amount or percentage of the amount of your 
Card-Linked Offer or Gift Card purchase. All 
calculations and determinations, including whether any 
particular transaction meets the requirements to earn 
Points, shall be performed by the Company at its sole 
discretion. Satlantis uses our exchange partners to 
determine the price of bitcoin at the time of Point 
accrual. The Company adds an additional spread to the 
bitcoin Dollar value determined at our discretion in 
order to protect against price fluctuations from the 
time of bitcoin exchange rate calculation to the time of 
purchase. For example, if the exchange rate is 1 
bitcoin = $10,000, we would subtract x% from the 
exchanged value, making it 1 bitcoin = $10.000(1-x) 
bitcoin.

(d) Referral Bonuses, Educational Bonuses, Random Point 
Awards, Signup Bonuses, Participation Bonuses, and 
Sweepstakes. Satlantis may offer referral bonuses, 
educational bonuses, random point awards, signup 
bonuses, participation bonuses, and sweepstakes from 
time to time. Each of these bonuses, sweepstakes or 
awards will be subject to their own terms and 
conditions, which you must agree to in advance of 
your participation.

(e) Adjustments. You hereby acknowledge and agree that 
any Points granted to you by the Company under the 
Program are givenwithout consideration or payment of any 
kind from you. The Company may make reasonable 
adjustments to any Points balance, including adjustments 
to the Available or Pending Balance in your Account, at 
any time without advance notice if in its reasonable 
judgment the Company finds such adjustments are necessary.
(f) Account Limits. We may set a limit on the number of 
Points you may have in your Account on any calendar day 
under the Program(the “Account Limit”). The imposition 
and level of any Account Limit will be entirely in our
discretion. If we choose to set an

Account Limit on your Account, you will be notified. 
The Account Limit will include Points in the Pending 
Balance and Points in the Available Balance. Whether 
or not you have an Account Limit, you may not Convert 
Points, which, if converted into Sats, would be valued 
at more than two thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine 
Dollars ($2,999) in a single calendar day. The total 
Point value of your Conversions executed in a day 
cannot exceed any applicable Account Limit.

(g) Exchange Rates. The Company calculates the value 
of bitcoin using the exchange rates provided by certain 
data feeds, asdetermined by the Company. All 
calculations and determinations, including the 
determination of bitcoin value on any given event date, 
shall be performed by the Company at its sole 
discretion. Except where prohibited by applicable law, 
which may include Quebec, the Company hereby disclaims 
any and all liability in connection with (i) incorrect 
information obtained from third parties regarding the 
value of bitcoin on any given date, or (ii) any 
disputes over the value of bitcoin on any given date.

(h) Holds & Transfers. We will hold any Points earned 
for a Qualifying Purchase if such Points would cause 
either (i) your Accountbalance to exceed the Account 
Limit, based on our calculation of the value of bitcoin 
on that day, or (ii) the total of all yourConversions 
executed that day plus your total Account balance to 
exceed the Account Limit. Your held Points will be 
credited when your Account balance goes below the 
Account Limit.

You may not transfer any Points in your Account to 
other Members, or cause Points for a Qualifying 
Purchase to be credited to another Member. Your Account, 
including any Points contained in it, may not be 
assigned or granted to, or inherited by, any other 
person or party.

(i) Errors. It is your responsibility to check your 
Account regularly to ensure that Points have been 
properly credited and Convertedand that your Account 
balance is accurate. If you believe that Points have 
not been correctly credited to your Account, you must 
contact us within thirty (30) days of the Qualifying 
Purchase. In the event we determine, in our sole 
discretion, that you have been credited Points which 
were misapplied by us for any reason, we may deduct the 
misapplied Points from your Account. If you have 
Converted the misapplied Points, you agree to promptly 
return to us the balance of the misapplied Points, less 
10,000 Sats, which you may keep. If you refuse to 
promptly return the misapplied Converted Points, you 
agree to reimburse us for all costs and reasonable 
legal fees associated with our recovery of the 
misapplied Converted Points. Should you disagree 
with any adjustments made to your Account or Points 
credited to you, your sole remedy is to withdraw from 
the Program.

5. Additional Qualifying Purchase Terms

Points earned for Qualifying Purchases made with your 
Member Card are subject to adjustment as a result of 
chargebacks, returns, refunds, or other determinations 
that the Points were not earned in compliance with 
these Terms. If you make a Qualifying Purchase and your 
Account is credited with Points, any later return, 
reversal, cancellation or dispute involving any part 
of the Qualifying Purchase will result in your Points 
balance being reversed, debited or cancelled (in whole 
or part) to reflect that portion of the Qualifying 
Purchase which has been returned, reversed, cancelled 
or disputed and may cause your Points balance to go 
negative. We may apply future Points or any Points 
not yet Converted until enough Points are accrued to 
cover the negative balance. Points are held in the 
Pending Balance for a period of up to ninety (90) days, 
or longer where additional information is required from 
the Merchant or Card Network, after the Qualifying 
Purchase and cannot be Converted until after they are 
moved to the Available Balance. The Company may change 
the criteria for Qualifying Purchases at any time and 
may notify you of those changes via in App notifications 
and/or updates to these Terms.

Not all transactions with your registered Member Card 
are tracked by Visa, MasterCard and American Express,
as applicable. You acknowledge that Visa, MasterCard, 
and American Express as applicable may be unable to 
monitor every transaction made with your enrolled Member 
Card, PIN-based purchases, purchases you initiate 
through identification technology that substitutes for 
a PIN, payments made through other payment methods (such 
as a digital wallet or a third party payment app, where 
you may choose your Visa, MasterCard, or American 
Express card as a funding source but you do not present 
your Member Card directly to the merchant), payments of 
existing balances, balance transfers, or transactions 
that are not processed or submitted through the Visa 
U.S.A. (for Member Cards registered in the United 
States), MasterCard, and American Express payment 
systems as applicable, and that these transactions are 
not eligible to be Qualifying Purchases.

If you register a debit card as a Member Card, your 
transaction must be processed as a ‘credit’ (i.e., 
signature) transaction to make sure the transaction 
can be monitored and you can earn Points. Do not use a 
Personal Identification Number (PIN) when paying for 
your purchases with your Member Card if you want the 
transaction to be eligible to earn Points. Not all cards 
are eligible and not all transactions can be monitored. 
For debit cards, run transaction as credit, do not use 
PIN. $250 max USD value of Points per transaction and 
other offers may apply.

6. Additional Gift Card Terms

(a) Limitations. All Gift Cards are subject to 
availability and we reserve the right to impose 
quantity limits on any order, to reject all orany 
part of an order, or to discontinue products without

maintain on one Visa Gift Card is $999 and the 
total/aggregate amount you may load and maintain on 
one Merchant Gift Card is $1,999. The total/aggregate

Merchant Gift Card, you may be required to activate 
the Gift Card by followingthe instructions provided

other provided instructions. The Gift Card may only

Gift Cards may be available within seconds; however, 
additional time may be required for certain activations. 
If your Gift Card has not been activated within 30 
seconds, please contact us at support@Satlantis.com.

(c) Terms. Gift Cards purchased via our Website or the 
App are issued and activated by third parties, including 
banks and the Merchants. Your purchase of each Gift Card 
will be governed by certain terms and conditions 
established by Visa, the issuer, or the Merchant, as 
applicable, and by purchasing a Gift Card, you must 
agree to and comply with those terms and conditions. 
Depending on the applicable law of your jurisdiction, 
Visa, the issuer, or the Merchant may set expiration 
dates for such Gift Cards, in addition to other 
restrictions and requirements. You should review and 
familiarize yourself with all applicable Visa, issuer, 
or Merchant terms and conditions prior to purchasing 
or Converting points for any Gift Card. If you have 
questions regarding the applicable terms, please contact 
Visa, the issuer, the Merchant, or the point of contact 
for such inquiries disclosed on the Gift Card.

(d) Liability. The Gift Card issuers, Gift Card 
processors and the Merchants (and not Satlantis) are 
fully responsible for all aspects ofthe Gift Card 
programs following the purchase of the Gift Card. While 
the Company strives to work with reputable Merchants and 
issuers, except where prohibited by applicable law, 
which may include Quebec, the Company has no liability 
for (i) the sale of products or services to you by a 
Merchant through the use of any Gift Card; and (ii) the 
Gift Card issuer’s or any Merchant’s failure to honor a 
Gift Card. You will need to look solely to the Gift Card 
issuer or the Merchant for any remedy in connection with 
the foregoing issues.

(e) Errors. We attempt to be as accurate as possible and 
to eliminate errors on the products that we sell; 
however, Satlantis doesnot represent or warrant that any 
Gift Card and information about the Gift Card (including 
the description, Merchant information or pricing 
information) provided is accurate, complete, reliable, 
current or error-free. In the event of an error, in an 
order confirmation, in processing a Gift Card purchase, 
in connection with a Conversion or redemption of Points, 
or otherwise, we reserve the right to correct such error 
and revise your order accordingly (including charging 
the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any 
amount charged.

(f) Disclaimers. Except where prohibited by applicable 
law, which may include Quebec, you waive and release 
Satlantis and itssubsidiaries, affiliates, partners, 
officers, directors, employees, agents and Third-Party 
Service Providers from any liabilities, damages and 
costs arising from or related to (i) the loss, including 
loss in transit to you, or the theft of any Gift Card; 
and (ii) any act or omission of Visa, the issuer, or a 
Merchant in connection with a Gift Card it provides.

you complete your purchase of the applicable Gift Card. 
Satlantis is not responsible for any damage or loss 
resulting from stolen or lost Gift Cards or any use of 
your Gift Cards without your permission.

The Company is not responsible for replacing your 
damaged or lost Gift Card.

These disclaimers and limitations may or may not 
apply to you and are void where prohibited.

(g) Taxes. The amount paid for any Gift Card does not 
include sales, harmonized, value added or use taxes, 
which may be chargedto you separately by the applicable 
Merchant at the time you purchase products or services 
from the Merchant using the Gift Card.

7. How You Can Convert Point to Bitcoin

(a) Information Requirements. As a condition of 
Conversion of your Points, you must provide the Company 
with the informationnecessary to process your Conversion 
which may include: your first and last name, an email 
address, a Bitcoin address or Bitcoin payment invoice or 
a Bitcoin Node ID which you own and control or that is 
associated with a Bitcoin address or Node ID you own and 
control, and any other information the Company 
reasonably requests. By initiating a Conversion, you are 
confirming that you, exclusively, own and control the 
Bitcoin withdrawal address or Node ID, and no other 
entity, individual, or custodian has access to, control 
over, or ownership of these funds, the withdrawal 
address, node, or private keys/signing credentials 
associated with this address, node, or funds. If you 
elect to close your Account before you have Converted 
all of the Points in your Available Balance, the Company 
will make commercially reasonable efforts to give you an 
opportunity to Convert such Points, but you hereby 
acknowledge and agree that by electing to close your 
Account you abandon any claim and forfeit all rights to 
the remaining Points in your Account at that time. The 
Company shall not be liable to you for the value or 
value upon Conversion, if any, of any Points in your 
Account at the time you elect to close your Account. You 
further agree to provide additional information we may 
reasonably request to verify your identity as a 
condition for Conversion.

(b) Conversion. Points have no cash or fiat currency 
value. In Canada, each Point will have a conversion 
value equal to 1 Sat and inall other jurisdictions, 
Satlantis reserves the right to determine the conversion 
value of a Point from time to time, which it will 
disclose to you at the time of any conversion 
transaction (the “Conversion Rate”). The Available 
Balance of Points in your Account may only be redeemed 
by converting the Points to Sats pursuant to the 
Conversion Rate. We may offer additional ways to redeem 
your Points in the future. Points may only be Converted 
by the Member who earned them. Conversions are typically 
processed weekly, but may be processed more or less 
frequently at the Company’s sole discretion.

(c) Minimum Conversion Amount. You must have at least 
50,000 Sats worth of Points in your Available Balance 
in order to beeligible to Convert Points. The company 
may raise or lower these limits from time to time.

(d) Costs of Conversion. Each time you Convert Points, 
we will deduct any amounts necessary from the total 
converted amount of Sats to cover any withdrawal fees, 
miner fees, lightning routing fees, and associated 
operational fees, custodial fees, pass through fees, 
and other expenses associated with the Conversion. 
These deductions will be disclosed to you in advance 
of any Conversion and you may choose not to proceed 
with the Conversion if you do not wish to pay the 
	deductions.

(e) Taxes. You may be taxed on your Conversion of 
Points depending on the tax laws of federal, state, 
provincial, and localjurisdictions. You will be solely 
responsible for any and all tax liability arising out 
of the consideration received in connection with the 
Program. We may need to collect certain identifying 
information from you in order to fulfill our tax 
reporting obligations, and in the event you refuse to 
provide such information, you may forfeit your Points.

8. How You Could Lose Your Points/Point Expiration.

Your Points don’t expire as long as your Account is open 
and in good standing, however, you will immediately lose 
all your Points if your Account becomes an Inactive 
Account, or your Account is closed, for any of the 
following reasons:

you fail to comply with these Terms or other agreements 
you have with the Company; you file for bankruptcy; we 
believe that you’ve engaged in fraudulent activity 
related to your Account or the Program; we believe that 
you’ve misused the Program in any way, for example:

	1. by purchasing Gift Cards for resale or transfer;
	2. by engaging in Prohibited Conduct as described 
	   below; or
	3. by repeatedly opening or otherwise maintaining 
	   Accounts for the purpose of generating Points.

Upon cancellation of your Account for any reason, we 
will notify you and you will lose all Points 
immediately, regardless of when or how they were 
acquired. You hereby acknowledge and agree that by 
allowing your Account to become an Inactive Account, 
you abandon any claim and forfeit all rights to the 
Points in your Account at that time and any associated 
gains or losses. The Company shall not be liable to 
you for the value of any Points, or any gains or losses 
associated with the value of the Points in your Account, 
at the time your Account is closed for inactivity or 
violation of terms in accordance with this Section.

If we decide to cancel the Program, you’ll have at least 
thirty (30) days from the date we cancel the Program to 
Convert your Points, as long as you don’t lose them for 
any of the reasons described in these Terms. If you 
don’t use or Convert your Points during that time, 
you’ll lose them. We won’t reinstate Points you lose, 
unless we’ve determined, in our sole discretion, there 
has been an error.

9. Accounts

(a) Registration. You must have an Account to 
participate in the Program. You do not need to provide 
your name or email addressto open an Account. Accounts 
can be opened by providing a username, accessible via 
a recovery token, rather than your email address and a 
password (we call these accounts “anonymous” although 
we may be able to link the Account to you such as if you 
link your payment card information to the Account). If 
you have an anonymous Account, you will be able to earn 
Points, but your Points will not be eligible for 
Conversion. In order to be eligible to make a 
Conversion, you will be required to register your 
Account with a verified email address and create a password.

(b) Unsecured. Your Account is not a financial account 
and does not carry a balance in Dollars, bitcoin, Sats, 
or in any other fiat ordigital currency on your behalf; 
it merely (a) records a general unsecured commercial 
obligation to you by the Company, as described herein, 
and (b) allows the Company to coordinate your 
participation in the program. “Earn bitcoin”, 
“earning bitcoin”, “Stacking sats”, “Stacking sweet 
sweet cheddar”, “silently stockpiling succulent sats”, 
and other similar terms and phrases used in connection 
with the Program means the right to earn Points which 
may be Converted to Sats, as determined within the 
Company’s reasonable discretion. It does not mean that 
any bitcoin, Sats or any funds whatever, are held on 
your behalf. Further, by agreeing to these Terms, you 
represent that you understand that you do not have 
right, legal title or a security interest in any 
particular assets of Satlantis, and you understand 
and agree that the only remedies available to you for 
controversies arising from these Terms or your use of 
the Program generally will be at law and as a general 
unsecured creditor.

(c) Account Security. Any use of your username or 
password will be deemed to be your use, and the Company 
is entitled to act oninstructions received under your 
password. You agree not to share your password with any 
third party and the Company is not responsible for any 
changes made to your Account or Conversions of Points 
made by someone else who uses your password. If there is 
a breach of security through your Account, you will 
immediately change your password and notify us of such 
breach. You agree that, unless you have first notified 
us immediately of any such breach, we should assume that 
any instruction transmitted using your username and 
password is yours and has been authorized by you, and we 
will have no further obligation to investigate the 
propriety of such instruction. Our responsibility is 
limited to the exercise of ordinary diligence in giving 
access to your Account upon request and in preventing 
access to your Account by unauthorized persons. We are 
not responsible for any unauthorized access or loss or 
harm an unauthorized access causes, unless caused only 
by our gross negligence or our willful misconduct.

10. Access to the Program

The Company retains the right, at our sole discretion,
to deny service or use of the Program or an Account to 
anyone at any time and for any reason. Although we use 
reasonable efforts to keep the Program and your Account 
accessible, the Program and/or your enrollment may be 
unavailable from time to time. You understand and agree 
that there may be interruptions in service or events, 
Program access, or access to your Account due to 
circumstances both within our control (e.g., routine 
maintenance) and outside of our control. You agree that,

include Quebec, the Company will not be liable to you or 
to any third party for any modification, suspension or 
discontinuance of the Website, the App or the Program.

discretion, and failure to enforce this section in some 
instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to 
enforce it in other instances. In addition, this Section 
12 does not create any private right of action on the 
part of any third party or any reasonable expectation 
that the Program will not contain any content that is 
prohibited by such rules.

infringement with our Designated Agent as set forth 
below:

Attn: General Counsel

Address: Satlantis LLC, Inc. (dba “Satlantis”), 
2028 E Ben White Blvd #240, Mailbox 6969, Austin, 
TX 78741, United States

a proper notification. If you knowingly misrepresent in 
your notification that the material or activity is

alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such 
misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the 
material or activity claimed to be infringing.

17. Indemnification

include Quebec, you will indemnify, defend and hold 
harmless the Company and our subsidiaries and

directors, agents, partners and employees and our 
ThirdParty Service Providers (individually and 
collectively, the “Company Parties”) from and against

expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related 
to (a) your access to or use of the Program; (b) your 
Feedback; (c) your violation of these Terms; (d) your

rights of another (including intellectual property 
rights or privacy rights); or (e) your conduct in

third-party Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, 
and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a 
written agreement between you and Company or the other 
Company Parties.

If you are a California resident or resident of a state 
with a similar applicable law, you hereby expressly 
waive California Civil Code section 1542 in connection 
with the foregoing (or such other similar applicable law 
in your state), which states: “A general release does 
not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing 
party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her 
favor at the time of executing the release and that, 
if known by him or her, would have materially affected 
his or her settlement with the debtor or released 
party.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, 
you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.

18. Disclaimers and Risk Disclosure

(a) Disclaimer. YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF OUR PROGRAM IS 
AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE PROGRAM AND ANY CONTENT THEREIN 
ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. EXCEPT WHERE 
PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH MAY INCLUDE IN 
QUEBEC, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO 
APPLICABLE LAW, Satlantis AND ITS COMPANY PARTIES 
AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING CARD 
NETWORKS, CARD ISSUERS, AND PAYMENT PROCESSORS) 
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, COLLATERAL, STATUTORY, 
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES 
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR OR 
GENERAL PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. Satlantis AND 
ITS COMPANY PARTIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND 
SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING CARD NETWORKS AND PAYMENT 
PROCESSORS) DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THE DATA,

LIMITATION TRANSACTION DATA OR USER SUBMISSIONS OR OTHER 
DATA PROVIDED BY OTHER USERS, TO BE UNINTERRUPTED, 
ACCURATE, USEFUL, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER 
HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE 
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM.

(b) Value Fluctuation. Bitcoin values can fluctuate 
substantially. This means that although your Points can 
always be redeemed into Sats, the value of the Sats, if 
expressed in Dollars, can go down to $0. The Company 
does not own or control any of the software protocols 
that are used in connection with the Points. 
Accordingly, the Company disclaims all liability 
relating to such protocols and any value fluctuations in 
the Points, and makes no guarantees regarding the 
security, functionality or availability of such 
protocols.

(c) System Failure. You accept all risks associated with 
the use of the Points being convertible into Sats, and 
any failures thatmight arise as a result thereof, 
including, but not limited to, in connection with the 
failure of hardware, software, and internet connections. 
The nature of bitcoin means that any technological 
difficulties experienced by the Company may prevent us 
from being able to successfully Convert your Points to 
Sats.

(d) Market Disruptions. You agree that we are not liable 
for any price fluctuations in bitcoin. In the event of a 
market disruption,we may suspend the Program, your 
ability to earn Points and/or make Conversions. Except 
where prohibited by applicable law, which may include in 
Quebec, we will not be liable for any losses suffered by 
you resulting from such actions. Following any such 
event, when the Program resumes, you acknowledge that 
prevailing market rates may differ significantly from 
the rates available prior to such event.

(e) Risks Inherent to Bitcoin. (i) Bitcoin transactions 
are irreversible and, accordingly, losses due to 
fraudulent or accidentaltransactions may not be 
recoverable and except where prohibited by applicable 
law, which may include Quebec, the Company shall not be 
held liable for any fraudulent or accidental 
transactions; (ii) bitcoin is not legal tender and is 
not backed by a government or central bank and the 
Company is not a bank. As such, there is no protection, 
such as deposit insurance, to cover any losses 
associated with bitcoin (or Bitcoin); (iii) legislative 
and regulatory changes or actions at the state, 
provincial, federal or international level may adversely 
affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of 
bitcoin; (iv) the bitcoin public ledger blockchain is 
maintained by a vast unidentified private computer 
network spread around the world and choosing to 
participate in bitcoin is at your own risk and 
understanding of this network; (v) bitcoin and Bitcoin 
are a target for fraud and the potential for fraud is 
especially likely when you engage in transactions with 
external Bitcoin addresses; (vi) bitcoin and Bitcoin 
are a target for hackers and hacking can occur even when 
you use the strongest security settings and as such your 
bitcoin may be irretrievably stolen; (vii) your bank 
accounts are at increased risk of being hacked when 
linked to Bitcoin accounts; (viii) some bitcoin 
transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded 
and/or confirmed on a public ledger, which is not 
necessarily the date or time that you have initiated 
the transaction; (ix) the value of bitcoin may be 
derived from the continued willingness of market 
participants to exchange fiat currency for bitcoin, 
which may result in the potential for permanent and 
total loss of value of a particular bitcoin should the 
market for that bitcoin disappear; (x) there is no 
assurance that a person who accepts bitcoin as payment 
today will continue to do so in the future; (xi) the 
volatility and unpredictability of the price of bitcoin 
relative to fiat currency may result in significant 
loss over a short period of time; and (xii) any bond 
or trust account held by the Company may not be 
sufficient to cover all losses incurred by our customers.

19. Limitation of Liability

(a) Limitation. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW, WHICH MAY INCLUDE QUEBEC, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES 
WILL Satlantis OR ITS COMPANY PARTIES, AFFILIATES, 
CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS 
OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING CARD NETWORKS, CARD ISSUERS, OR 
PAYMENT PROCESSORS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, 
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY 
DAMAGES ARISING OR RELATED TO THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF SUCH 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.

(b) Cap. EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, 
WHICH MAY INCLUDE QUEBEC, IN NO EVENT WILL 
Satlantis’S OR ITS COMPANY PARTIES’, AFFILIATES’, 
CONTRACTORS’, EMPLOYEES’, AGENTS’, OR THIRD PARTY
PARTNERS’ OR SUPPLIERS’ (INCLUDING CARD NETWORKS’, 
CARD ISSUERS’, AND PAYMENT PROCESSORS’) TOTAL 
LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND 
CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE 
TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM (WHETHER IN CONTRACT,

YOU TO US IN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS TO USE OUR PROGRAM, 
OR (II) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).

(c) Exclusions. The limitations set forth in this 
Section 19 will not limit or exclude liability for 
the gross negligence, fraud orintentional misconduct of 
Company or the other Company Parties or for any other 
matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited 
under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions, 
including Quebec, may not allow the exclusion or 
limitation of incidental or consequential damages, 
so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to 
you.

20. Release

Except where prohibited by applicable law, which may 
include Quebec, you release Company and the other 
Company Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, 
demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of 
every kind and nature, known and unknown (including 
claims of negligence), arising out of or related to 
disputes between Members and the acts or omissions of 
third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in 
California, you hereby waive your rights under 
California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A 
general release does not extend to claims which the 
creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or 
her favor at the time of executing the release, which if 
known by him or her must have materially affected his or 
her settlement with the debtor.”

21. Transfer and Processing Data

In order for us to provide our Programs, we may process, 
transfer and store information about you in the United 
States, Canada and other countries, where we and our 
service providers are located, where you may not have 
the same rights and protections as you do under local 
law. For more information, please see our Privacy 
Policy.

22. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

Please read the following section carefully because it 
requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims 
with Company and limits the manner in which you can seek 
relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by 
following the instructions set forth below. Except where 
prohibited by applicable law, which may include Quebec, 
no class or representative actions or arbitrations are 
allowed under this arbitration provision and arbitration 
precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

(a) No Representative Actions. Except where prohibited by 
applicable law, which may include Quebec, you and Company 
agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these 
Terms or our Program is personal to you and Company and 
that any dispute will be resolved solely through 
individual action, and will not be brought as a class 
arbitration, class action or any other type of 
representative proceeding.

(b) Arbitration of Disputes. Except where prohibited by 
applicable law, which may include Quebec, and except for 
small claimsdisputes in which you or Company seeks to 
bring an individual action in small claims court located 
in the county of your billing address or disputes in 
which you or Company seeks injunctive or other equitable 
relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation 
of intellectual property, you and Company waive your 
rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute 
arising out of or related to these Terms or our Program, 
including claims related to privacy and data security, 
(collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Instead, 
for any Dispute that you have against Company you agree 
to first contact Company and attempt to resolve the 
claim informally by sending a written notice of your 
claim (“Notice”) to Company by email at 
legal@Satlantis.com. The Notice must (a) include your 
name, residence address, email address, and telephone 
number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the 
Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. 
Our notice to you will be similar in form to that 
described above. If you and Company cannot reach an 
agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days 
after such Notice is received, then either party may 
submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered 
by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth 
above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be 
resolved through confidential, binding arbitration 
before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be 
held in Travis County, Texas unless you are a consumer, 
in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in 
your county of residence. For purposes of this Section 
22, a “consumer” means a person using the Programs for 
personal, family or household purposes. You and Company 
agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the 
JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures 
(“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS 
Rules are available on the JAMS website and are hereby 
incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and 
agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules 
or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and 
waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or 
should not apply for any reason.

(c) FAA. Except where prohibited by applicable law,
which may include Quebec, you and Company agree that 
these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the 
enforceability of thisSection 22 will be substantively 
and procedurally governed bythe Federal Arbitration 
Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”). As limited by 
the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator 
will have exclusive authority to make all procedural 
and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to
grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in 
court, including the power to determine the question of 
arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an 
individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than 
one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class 
or representative proceeding or preside over any 
proceeding involving more than one individual.

(d) Confidentiality. The arbitration will allow for
the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information
relevant to the Dispute.The arbitrator, Company, and 
you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration 
proceedings, judgments and awards, including information 
gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the 
arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The 
arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate 
rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law 
provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality 
does not apply to the extent that disclosure is 
necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration 
hearing on the merits, in connection with a court 
application for a preliminary remedy or in connection 
with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its 
enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is 
otherwise required by law or judicial decision. 

(e) Costs. You and Company agree that for any 
arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee 
(up to a maximum of $250 ifyou are a consumer), and 
Company will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. 
For any arbitration initiated by Company, Company will 
pay all JAMS fees and costs.

(f) Jurisdiction. You and Company agree that the state 
or federal courts of the State of Texas and the United 
States sitting in Travis County, Texas have exclusive 
jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an 
arbitration award.

(g) Time Limit. Any Dispute must be filed within one 
year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the 
Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you 
and Company will not have the right to assert the claim.

(h) Opt-Out. You have the right to opt out of binding 
arbitration within 30 days of the date you first 
accepted the terms of this  Section 22 by emailing 
support@Satlantis.com. In order to be effective, 
the opt-out notice must include your full name and 
address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out 
of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding 
arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes 
in accordance with Section 23, unless otherwise 
prohibited by applicable law, which may include the laws 
of Quebec.

(i) Severability. If any portion of this Section 22 is 
found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, 
(a) the unenforceableor unlawful provision shall be 
severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the 
unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact 
whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 22 or the 
parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining 
claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 
22; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore 
proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or 
representative basis, such claims must be litigated in
a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of 
those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any 
individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part 
of this Section 22 is found to prohibit an individual 
claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision 
will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed 
to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of 
this Section 22 will be enforceable.  

23. Governing Law and Venue

Except where prohibited by
applicable law, which may include Quebec, any dispute 
arising from these Terms and your access or use of the 
Program will be governed by and construed and enforced 
in accordance with the laws of Texas, except to the 
extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard 
to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Texas 
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the 
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any 
dispute between the parties that is not subject to
arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court 
will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Texas 
and the United States, respectively, sitting in Travis 
County, Texas.

24. Changes to the Terms and Additional Terms.

We may make changes to the Program and the Terms at any 
time and at our sole discretion. For example, we may 
temporarily or permanently prohibit you from earning 
Points, Converting Points in your Available Balance, or 
using any features of the Program at any time and at our 
sole discretion, and/or we may:  	

1. add new Program Terms, delete Program Terms or 
change existing Program Terms;
2. change how you earn Points;
3. change how you may Convert Points; and 
4. expire Points.  We may supply different or additional 
terms in relation to our Program or some of our 
anticipated Programs, and those different or additional 
terms become part of these Terms if you use such 
Programs. If there is a conflict between these Terms and 
the additional terms, the additional terms will control 
for that conflict. We reserve the right to terminate, 
expire, modify or restrict any aspect of the Program at 
any time with or without notice, including cancellation 
of your Membership in the Program with or without cause. 
We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to 
your inability to access or use our Program.

25. Notice of Changes.

We’ll give you thirty (30) days’ notice (or such longer 
period as required by applicable law) of the following 
types of changes to the Program or these Terms:

1. if we add or increase fees applicable to the Program; 
2. if we change the limits on the number of Points you 
can earn; and 
3. if we cancel the Program. We’ll send this notice to 
you in writing, which, at our option, may be delivered 
to you electronically by email, text message, or through 
our online services, such as the Website or the App, or 
as otherwise required by applicable law, and such notice 
will (i) clearly specify the elements of the Program or 
Terms being changed, and (ii) set out the new clause or

26. Severability

If any  provision or part of a provision of these Terms 
is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or 
part of the provision is deemed severable from these 
Terms and does not affect the validity and 
enforceability of any remaining provisions.

rights and obligations under these terms or subcontract 
or delegate its rights and obligations under these 
terms to third parties without your consent. All

and assigns. You may not transfer or assign these Terms 
(or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms) 
to another person or entity.

29. Miscellaneous

The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right 
or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver 
of such right or provision. These Terms reflect the 
entire agreement between the parties relating to the 
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior 
agreements, representations, statements and 
understandings of the parties. The section titles in 
these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal 
or contractual effect. Use of the word “including” will 
be interpreted to mean “including without limitation.” 
Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are 
intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are 
not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights
upon any other person or entity. ]]
